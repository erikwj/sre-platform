Hackathon Idea Summary: AI-Powered Incident & Postmortem Platform
Problem Statement
Currently, incident management and postmortems are disconnected and inefficient:

During incidents: Updates scattered in SharePoint documents, accessible only via email links
After incidents: Timeline data is discarded; postmortems written from scratch in Azure DevOps/Word
No learning loop: Patterns across incidents invisible, same issues repeat
Poor tooling: Azure DevOps lacks necessary fields; Word docs are unstructured
Teaching burden: Significant time spent teaching people how to write proper postmortems

Solution: Unified Incident-to-Postmortem Platform
A comprehensive web platform that manages the entire incident lifecycle from live response through postmortem analysis, powered by AI to reduce manual work and surface patterns.
Core Features
1. Live Incident Management (replaces SharePoint)

Create incidents with severity, affected services, incident commander
Shareable link for email notifications
Real-time timeline updates with timestamps
Anyone can view; authorized users add updates
Links to changes, PRs, affected components

2. AI-Powered Postmortem Generation

One-click postmortem creation from incident data
AI auto-extracts timeline (start, detection, mitigation, resolution times)
Pre-fills root cause, affected services, linked changes
Suggests action items based on incident updates
Support for methodologies: 5 Whys, Swiss Cheese Model
Real-time coaching as users write

3. Historical Data Import

Drag-and-drop Word document postmortems (.docx)
AI parses unstructured documents and extracts:

Timeline data
Root causes
Action items
Linked incidents/changes


Bulk import capability

4. Pattern Recognition Dashboard

Aggregates all incidents and postmortems
AI identifies recurring issues (e.g., "Certificate expiry: 8 incidents")
Visualizes trends: MTTD, MTTR, common failure modes
Links related incidents for deep-dive analysis

Target Hackathon Pillar
Reliability - Improves incident response and enables learning from failures to prevent repeat incidents
Key Value Propositions

Eliminates data loss: Timeline updates become structured, searchable data
Reduces manual work: 70% of postmortem pre-filled automatically
Accelerates learning: Pattern recognition surfaces systemic issues
Improves quality: AI coaching helps teams write better postmortems
Centralizes knowledge: Single source of truth for all incidents and postmortems
